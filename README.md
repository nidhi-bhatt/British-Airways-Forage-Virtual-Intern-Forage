## Overview
This repository contains my work for the British Airways Data Science Job Simulation on Forage, completed in September 2024. The simulation focused on leveraging data science for British Airways' success through web scraping, data analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis
- Scraped customer review data from Skytrax
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conducted sentiment analysis on customer reviews
- Created visualizations including word clouds and sentiment distribution charts

### 2. Predictive Modeling for Customer Bookings
- Explored and prepared the dataset for modeling
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer bookings
- Evaluated model performance using cross-validation
- Analyzed feature importance for business insights

## Key Insights

### Customer Reviews Analysis
- Overall positive sentiment (57.89%), with areas for improvement
- Comfort and Food received highest positive sentiment scores
- Delay-related issues identified as a key area for improvement
- Mixed experiences reported for service quality

### Booking Prediction Model
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression
- Geographic and trip-specific factors most predictive of bookings
- Time-related features (lead time, stay length, flight time) play significant roles
- Weekend vs. weekday travel has minimal impact on booking likelihood

## Skills Demonstrated
- Web scraping
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Sentiment analysis
- Machine learning (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Data visualization
- Business insight generation
